Getting Started
-----------------
Before running the examples, make sure you have a AMQP broker ready. The easiest way to do so is running:

```shell
$ docker run -d -m 512M -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 viros/rabbitmq:3
``` 

Will can now check if the broker is working by accessing the management interface at http://localhost:15672. (username/password = "guest")
